    "description": "When it comes to understanding and implementing the various design patterns that are commonly used the typical go to resource is the Gang of four design patterns book. However, this is quite a technical and dry book to get your head around. For new developers / designers I like to use \"Head first\" as it's a much more engaging explanation of the main design patterns in common use."

Also as so many of my clients were asking the same questions, I thought it was probably something which would be desired by many other organisations / developers."
