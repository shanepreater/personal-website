    "description": "When it comes to understanding and implementing the various design patterns that are commonly used the typical go to resource is the Gang of four design patterns book. However, this is quite a technical and dry book to get your head around. For new developers / designers I like to use \"Head first\" as it's a much more engaging explanation of the main design patterns in common use."

You create a board and then decide on some swim lanes and finally create some tickets (cards) which can then be assigned and progressed through the board. My team and I use it as a really simple backlog when we are working on projects which don't require the added functionality of something like Jira, this is a great choice."

I was introduced to Intellij on one of my clients projects, as it was the IDE for their whole team. Although I think the debugging experience in Eclipse is better, this is about the only thing that Eclipse nudges ahead of Intellij on. I have now used the ultimate edition for several years, and I find it efficient (probably because I have almost all the keyboard shortcuts memorised now) and the plugin architecture to be seamless. Also it seems to have good plugins for most of my needs."
