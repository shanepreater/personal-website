However, this is quite a technical and dry book to get your head around. For new developers / designers I like to use \"Head first\" as it's a much more engaging explanation of the main design patterns in common use."

You create a board and then decide on some swim lanes and finally create some tickets (cards) which can then be assigned and progressed through the board. My team and I use it as a really simple backlog when we are working on projects which don't require the added functionality of something like Jira, this is a great choice."

I was introduced to Intellij on one of my clients projects, as it was the IDE for their whole team. Although I think the debugging experience in Eclipse is better, this is about the only thing that Eclipse nudges ahead of Intellij on. I have now used the ultimate edition for several years, and I find it efficient (probably because I have almost all the keyboard shortcuts memorised now) and the plugin architecture to be seamless. Also it seems to have good plugins for most of my needs."
